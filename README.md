# MathsDataset Overview

This project aims to leverage the challenge of creating an ML model capable of answering mathematical questions provided in a LaTex format in order to improve my existing data engineering skills, learn new relevant skills, implement best practices, and showcase my working knowledge of the major undercurrents of the data engineering lifecycle. This includes Security, Data Management, DataOps, Data Architecture, Orchestration, and Software Engineering.

###### Data Sources
The main data source used in this project is the MATH dataset collected from https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/math. It contains mathematical questions and their corresponding answers in LaTeX textual format, designed for machine learning tasks, especially for training models to answer math problems. MATH dataset consists of 12,500 challenging competition mathematics problems, each with a full step-by-step solution to teach models to generate answer derivations and explanations. The dataset includes various question types like arithmetic, algebra, calculus, and more, making it an essential resource for developing and testing machine learning models for mathematical question answering tasks.
